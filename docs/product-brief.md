## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Beta Program (Weeks 1-4)
**Objective:** Learn from real users to refine product and create authentic marketing materials

**Beta Cohort:** 3 testers (already identified and positioned)
- Mix of individual believers and potential influencers
- Represent different use cases (home study, small group, field scenarios)

**Beta Process:**
1. **Kickoff:** 60-minute Zoom onboarding meeting per tester
2. **Deployment:** Scott handles all procurement, building, configuration, testing, shipping
3. **Usage Period:** 2-4 weeks hands-on with units (DIY, Solo, and Field SKUs)
4. **Feedback Loop:** 1:1 "user experience tuning" discussions - "How can we do better?"
5. **Content Creation:** Based on beta learning:
   - Marketing trailers showcasing real usage
   - Capability demonstrations
   - Product tutorials
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Support wiki documentation

**Beta Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Build and ship beta units (Field Kit prototype ready in <2 weeks)
- **Week 3-4:** User testing and feedback collection
- **Week 5-6:** Content creation based on beta insights

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Month 2+)

### Primary Goal: Waitlist Signups
**Target:** 100 signups in first month post-beta  
**Conversion:** 10% waitlist → customers (10 units sold)

### Revenue Projection: First 100 Units (Individuals Only)

Based on 70% individual market segment with SKU distribution:

| SKU | % of Individuals | Units | Price | Revenue |
|-----|------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Bare Bones | 15% | 11 | $99 | $1,089 |
| Solo Starter | 70% | 49 | $299 | $14,651 |
| Field Kit | 15% | 10 | $499 | $4,990 |

**Target Margin:** 60%+  
**Gross Profit (est):** $12,438+
