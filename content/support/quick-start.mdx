<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Inserting a microSD image the correct way is critical
</Callout>

1. You should have received one or perhas two microSD cards
2. If you are looking for build instructions to make those images, you are in the wrong section.
3. First, if the Pi is running, shut it down by holding the power button for 5 seconds. The LED light should turn red.
4. Disconnect the USB-C power cable. This might be from an AC power supply from the Cannakit, or from a battery pack you own
5. If there is a microSD card in the Pi already, you must carefully remove it, use your finger nail and back it out
6. With the new microSD card, insert it carefully into the Pi. Note that it goes in with the gold leads facing up. There is only one way it does in. Just don't force it in, you are likely to damage the card.
7. Now, re-insert the power supply cable or the battery pack USB-C power cable
8. The Pi will start on its own. When fully booted, about 60-90 seconds, the LED light will turn green
9. The Pi will begin broadcasting a hotspot Wi-Fi connection
10. You can join that when you are ready.
