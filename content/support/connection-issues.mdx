## Common Connection Problems

### Can't Find 'rapture_kit' WiFi Network

**Symptoms:**
- 'rapture_kit' network doesn't appear in WiFi list
- Network appears then disappears
- Network signal is very weak

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Power Status**
   - Ensure device is powered on
   - LED should be solid green when ready
   - If LED is red, it means the Pi has not been turned on
   - Note the LED might be red if the battery is drained. If so, charge the battery

2. **Check Distance**
   - Move closer, perhaps within 30 feet of RKPi5
   - Ensure no thick walls between devices. This reduces the reach of the Wi-Fi signal.
   - Avoid interference from other electronics

3. **Restart RKPi5**
   ```
   1. Press and hold power button for 5 seconds (device shuts down)
   2. Wait 10 seconds
   3. Press power button briefly to boot up
   4. Wait 60-90 seconds for complete boot
   5. The LED light will turn from red to quickly blinking green, then to solid green when fully booted
   ```

### Can't Connect to RKPi5 Network

**Symptoms:**
- Network appears but won't connect
- Connection times out

**Solutions:**

1. **Forget and Reconnect**
   - Remove 'rapture_kit' by fogetting this network from your device
   - Search for network again, it will appear in a few seconds
   - Join the 'rapture_kit' Wi-Fi hotspot
   - You should see the captive portal hotspot

2. **Check Client Limit**
   - RKPi5 supports concurrent users, but there is a decreased capacity the more users that are connected
   - More important is the type of media these clients are consuming
   - For example, if multiple people are watching video, the throughput will be diminished
   - If the RKPi5 is under heavy load, there might be refusals to connect
   - Wait a bit and try again

### Connected but Can't Access the Captive Portal

**Symptoms:**
- Connected to WiFi but portal won't load
- Browser shows "Cannot reach site"
- Long loading times with no results

**Solutions:**

1. **Try Alternate URLs**
   Try thise IP number in your browser:
   ```
   http://10.42.0.1
   https://10.42.0.1
   ```

2. **Check Browser Cache**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Try a different browser
   - Try a different device

3. **Verify Network Connection**
   - Ensure you're connected to RKPi5 network (no internet, or cellular connection is permitted)
   - Remember that the 'rapture_kit' hotspot will show 'no internet connected' this is not an error
   - Remember that if you navigate to a real website, you will be 'captive' and redirected to 'rapture_kit' landing Page
   - Check WiFi icon shows full connection

### Done with 'rapture_kit' captive portal

**Symptoms:**
- You try to navigate to a website but are blocked
- You get a 404 website not found error
- You are redirected back to the 'rapture_kit' captive portal

## This is a design feature, not a bug!

1. Disonnect from the 'rapture_kit' captive portal
2. Look for a cancel option, choosing this will disconnect and bring you back to the list of other available networds
3. Turn Wi-Fi off by flipping the toggle
4. Wait a few seconds, turn the toggle back on. The list of other available networks will reappear
5. Once on your detault Wi-Fi network, all internet connected services will be available
