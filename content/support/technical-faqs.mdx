# Technical FAQs

Technical questions and answers for advanced users and developers.

<Callout type="info" title="Beta Documentation">
Technical details will be refined during beta testing. This is for highly technical nerds!
</Callout>

## Hardware Technical Details

### What are the exact hardware specifications?

**Processor:**
- Broadcom BCM2712 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU
- Cryptography extensions, 512KB per-core L2 caches and a 2MB shared L3 cache
- VideoCore VII GPU, supporting OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.3

**Memory & Storage:**
- 8GB LPDDR4X-4267 SDRAM (1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB)
- 128GB microSD card (SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I)
- microSD card slot, with support for high-speed SDR104 mode
- 26GB+ content pre-loaded

**Connectivity:**

- 15W typical power consumption

**Other:**
- Raspberry Pi standard 40-pin header
- Real-time clock (RTC), powered from external battery (Note: purchased separately)
- Power button

### Can I upgrade the storage?

<Callout type="warning" title="Storage Options">
The RKPi5 persistent storage is solely on microSD cards, there is no hard disk
</Callout>

Technically yes, but not recommended:
- MicroSD card is accessible
- Can upgrade to larger capacity
- Must re-image with RKPi5 software
- Contact support for imaging instructions

### Can I connect external storage?

**microSD or USB storage**:
- **Optional** - USB storage mount points are built-in to the Raspberry Pi platform
- **mandatory** - microSD storage is where the operating system boots from
- **GENERAL NOTE**: The RKPi5 is complete with the microSD card that is preloaded with the operating system. At the time that the **golden master** microSD is created, it also loads Rapture Kit 3.1 static website content. Therefore, the single microSD card (with a best practices duplicate) is all that is needed. No external storage is required.

### What operating system does it run?

RKPi5 runs a customized Linux distribution:

- Base: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
- Version: 64-bit Trixie Operating System
- Kernel: Linux 6.1+
- Web Server: Nginx
- Media Server: Custom implementation on Nginx foundation

## Network & Connectivity

### What are the network specifications?

**As WiFi Access Point:**
```
SSID: rapture_kit (only customizable in the installer/configuration shell scripts [advanced users only])
Security: WPA2-PSK
Channels: Auto (2.4GHz) We optimize on 2.4GHz for compatibility
Gateway: 10.42.0.1
Max Clients: 10-15
```

**As WiFi Client:**
- Does not connect to the internet
- Cannot be used as a router or Bridge
- Only serves Wi-Fi captive portal static website content
- In a client device, such as a phone, tablet, or PC, you must disconnect from the RKPi5 and join another Wi-Fi connection for default behavior
- **NOTE**: Any attempt to navigate to another website while connected to the 'rapture_kit' network connection will be **forced** back to the Rapture Kit content.

### Can I change the IP address range?

- No, the IP is baked into the RKPi5 configuration scripts.
- Changing the default SSID name of 'rapture_kit' or the IP address requires editing the *.sh install scripts
- Thus, you are building a forked master image for your new specfications
- **NOTE**: This is not supported. You are on your own if you run into problems!

### Does it support WiFi 6 (802.11ax)?

No, Raspberry Pi 5 supports WiFi 5 (802.11ac) only. 

WiFi 5 is sufficient for:
- Up to 10-15 concurrent users
- HD video or MP3 audio streaming
- All current content

## Software & Development

### Can I SSH into the device?

**SSH Access:**
- Disabled by default for security!
- Can be enabled during installation of the Trixie operating system (for new builds only)
- Default port: 22
- Username/password are baked into the *.sh shell install scripts
- You can modify the user name and password in the scripts prior to forking the application

<Callout type="warning">
SSH access should only be used by advanced users. Incorrect modifications can break functionality.
</Callout>

### What programming languages are available?

Pre-installed:
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Bash
- PHP 8+

Additional languages can be installed via SSH if needed.

### Can I develop custom applications?

**All Tier:**
- Full access to DIY scripts
- Modify as desired
- Community support available

### Is there an API?

<Callout type="success" title="API Available">
RESTful API for accessing content and system features.
</Callout>

If you want a full development platform, the RKPi5 solution is not the correct starting point. What you are looking for is WAMPi.

### Can I backup the entire system?

**Backup Options:**

- To "backup" the microSD card, use a clone tool to do an image-to-image transfer between microSD cards.
- For example, we create a **golden master** image on a microSD card, then use Etcher or Pi Imager to make duplicates
- This is a standard Raspberry Pi operation, not specific to the RKPi5 solution
- Duplicating the microSD is permitted. It is wise to make at least one duplicate
- microSD cards are durable, but can show signs of wear or can sometimes get corrupted
- Having a backup microSD card gives you complete fault tollerance. There is no migration beween **old and new**

## Content & Media

### What media codecs are supported?

**Video:**
- H.264 (AVC) - Primary
- H.265 (HEVC) - Supported
- MP4 container

**Audio:**
- MP3 - Primary
- AAC - Supported
- OGG/Vorbis - Supported

**Subtitles:**
- SRT
- VTT
- Embedded subtitles

### What are the streaming bitrates?

**Video Quality Options:**
- 480p: ~1 Mbps (15 users simultaneously)
- 720p: ~3 Mbps (5 users simultaneously)
- 1080p: ~5 Mbps (3 users simultaneously)

Adaptive bitrate streaming adjusts based on available bandwidth.

### Can I transcode media?

Transcoding is automatic:
- Server detects client capabilities
- Adjusts quality automatically
- Balances quality vs. number of users

Manual transcoding:
- Available via admin panel
- Pre-generate lower quality versions
- Saves bandwidth for large groups

## Performance & Limits

### What are the performance specifications?

**Tested Scenarios:**

| Users | Video (720p) | Audio (128k) | Text Browsing |
|-------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1-3   | Excellent    | Excellent    | Instant       |
| 4-7   | Good         | Excellent    | Instant       |
| 8-12  | Fair         | Good         | Fast          |
| 13-15 | Limited      | Good         | Fast          |

### What are the absolute limits?

**Hard Limits:**
- 15 WiFi connections maximum (hardware)
- 5 simultaneous video streams (recommended)
- 15 simultaneous audio streams (recommended)
- 50 text browsers (estimated)

**Soft Limits:**
- Storage: 128GB (expandable)
- Battery: 6+ hours (replaceable)
- Range: ~100ft (antenna upgradeable)

### Can I monitor performance?

- No. This is a feature, not a bug or limitation.
- We are trying to protect users that access the RKPi5 from hostile actors

### What's included in the RKPi5 build scripts?

**All tiers use the same install scripts:**
- Complete setup scripts (these are .sh or shell scripts used by Linux)
- Automated installation (single script install orchestrates the other component scripts)
- Configuration templates (requires extreme expertise, don't recommend modivations)
- Content download (independent from https://rapturekit.org/download) requires a PC/Mac + monitor + keyboard + mouse
- Network setup is configured in the shell scripts and configure the Wi-Fi captive portal and static website content
- Content has a index.html page for the landing (home) page. Nginx routes to the Rapture Kit 3.1 home page automatically

### What do I need to build my own?

**Required Hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB recommended)
- MicroSD card (128GB+ recommended)
- Portable battery pack (20,000mAh+)
- USB-C power supply
- Case (optional)
- You will need a PC/Mac, monitor, keyboard, and mouse with internet connection to create a new **golden master** microSD card

**Estimated Cost:** $150-500 for all components depending on complexity and add-on options (solar panel, etc.)

### Is support available for DIY builds?

**DIY Support:**
- Community forums (perhaps in the future)
- Documentation (free)
- Email support (paid consultation available)

<Callout type="info">
DIY tier is for experienced users comfortable with Linux and Raspberry Pi.
