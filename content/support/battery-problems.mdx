Battery performance data and troubleshooting will be refined during beta testing.
</Callout>

## Battery Not Charging

**Symptoms:**
- Battery percentage not increasing
- No charging indicator
- Device shuts down when unplugged

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Charging Cable**
   - Ensure USB-C cable is fully inserted
   - Try a different USB-C cable
   - Check for damage to cable or port

2. **Verify Power Source**
   - Use included power adapter (5V/3A)
   - Try different wall outlet
   - Avoid low-power USB ports on computers

3. **Check LED Status**
   | LED Color | Status |
   |-----------|--------|
   | Red flashing | Charging |
   | Red solid | Low battery |
   | Green solid | Fully charged |
   | Amber | Charging error |

4. **Temperature Check**
   <Callout type="warning">
   Device may refuse to charge if too hot or too cold.
   </Callout>
   
   - Allow device to reach room temperature
   - Don't charge in direct sunlight
   - Ensure ventilation isn't blocked

## Battery Draining Too Fast

**Expected Runtime**: 6+ hours typical use

**Symptoms:**
- Battery depletes faster than 6 hours
- Sudden battery drops
- Inconsistent battery readings

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Number of Users**
   - More connected users = faster drain
   - Expected: 6+ hours with 3-5 users
   - With 10-15 users: 4-5 hours

2. **Check Content Usage**
   - Video streaming uses more power
   - Audio streaming uses less power
   - Text browsing uses minimal power

3. **Optimize Settings**
   - Reduce WiFi transmit power (if signal is strong)
   - Lower screen brightness on admin portal
   - Disable unnecessary services

4. **Battery Health**
   <CodeBlock title="Check Battery Health in Admin Panel">
   Settings → System → Battery Status
   Health: Should show 80%+ for new device
   Cycles: Track charge cycles
   </CodeBlock>

## Device Won't Power On

**Symptoms:**
- No response when pressing power button
- No LED indicators
- Completely unresponsive

**Solutions:**

1. **Charge the Battery**
   - Connect to charger for at least 30 minutes
   - Completely depleted batteries may show no immediate response
   - Wait for charging LED to appear

2. **Hard Reset**
   - Hold power button for 15 seconds
   - Release and wait 10 seconds
   - Press power button normally

3. **Check for Physical Damage**
   - Inspect device for damage
   - Check ports for debris
   - Ensure no moisture in ports

## Battery Percentage Incorrect

**Symptoms:**
- Battery shows 100% then immediately drops
- Percentage jumps around
- Shows 0% but device still works

**Solutions:**

1. **Calibrate Battery**
   ```
   1. Charge to 100%
   2. Use device until it shuts down (0%)
   3. Charge uninterrupted to 100%
   4. Battery meter should now be accurate
   ```

2. **Battery Statistics Reset**
   - Access admin panel
   - Navigate to System Settings
   - Click "Reset Battery Statistics"

## Extending Battery Life

### Best Practices

<Callout type="success" title="Pro Tips">
Follow these tips to maximize your RKPi5 battery life.
</Callout>

1. **Optimal Charging**
   - Charge between 20% and 80% for daily use
   - Full 0-100% cycles monthly for calibration
   - Avoid leaving on charger 24/7

2. **Usage Optimization**
   - Limit concurrent users when possible
   - Prefer audio over video content
   - Disable WiFi when not in use

3. **Storage Guidelines**
   - Store at 50-60% charge
   - Recharge every 3 months if stored
   - Keep in cool, dry location

### Expected Battery Lifespan

<Callout type="info">
Battery capacity naturally degrades over time.
</Callout>

- **New Device**: 6+ hours runtime
- **After 1 Year**: 5+ hours runtime (typical)
- **After 2 Years**: 4+ hours runtime (typical)
- **Charge Cycles**: 500+ cycles expected

## Battery Replacement

<Callout type="warning" title="Professional Service">
Battery replacement should only be performed by authorized service centers.
</Callout>

Signs you may need battery replacement:

- Runtime less than 3 hours with light use
- Battery health below 60%
- Physical swelling of battery
- Rapid capacity drops

**Contact support** if you believe you need a battery replacement.
