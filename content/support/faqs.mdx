## About RKPi5

### What is RKPi5?

RKPi5 is a portable, self-contained biblical resource platform based on Raspberry Pi 5. It provides 26GB+ of biblical content including audio, video, and text resources that work completely offline. The content is the EXACTLY the same as what is found on a Rapture Kit 3.1 USB drive. It is EXACTLY the same as https://didmillionsdisappear.com. The content is always the same, but the form factor on mobile, tablet, or pc is responsive, ensuring good visibility and user experience.

### Who is RKPi5 for?

RKPi5 is designed for:

- Believers that want to introduce the Rapture Kit content to any audience that joins the 'rapture_kit' hotspot
- Home Bible study groups, perhaps to share sermons for example
- Missionaries in remote locations
- Churches preparing for potential disruptions
- Families building emergency preparedness
- Anyone wanting offline access to biblical resources
- New Believers on the run after the Rapture. People that may have others to mentor and disciple. The use case for RKPi5 is perhaps the only methodology to educate, train, and encourage others after the internet tracks others expressing interest in a Biblical Worldview.

### Do I need internet to use RKPi5?

<Callout type="success" title="Completely Offline">
No internet connection required for normal operation.
</Callout>

RKPi5 works completely offline. Internet is only needed for:
- Initial setup (optional)
- If you have a pre-configured microSD card, you do not need to image Trixie OS or run the RKPi5 install scripts.
- Just carefully insert the microSD card into any Raspberry Pi 5 (recommended) and power on. In 60-90 seconds after booting, the 'rapture_kit' hotspot will be visible and able to join.

## Getting Started

### How long does setup take?

Setup takes less than 5 minutes:

1. Insert microSD card configured specifically for the RKPi5 solution
2. Power on device (60-90 seconds)
3. Connect to WiFi network (20-30 seconds)
4. Access portal (nearly instant)
5. Start using resources (immediately after home page loads)

### What devices can connect?

Any WiFi-enabled device:
- Smartphones (iPhone, Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android, Kindle)
- Laptops (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Desktop computers
- Chromebooks

### How many people can use it at once?

RKPi5 supports up to **15 concurrent users** connecting to the same device. This is possible with Raspberry Pi5 with at least 8GB of memory. Generally speaking, the more RAM the more the Pi can manage its resources.

## Content & Resources

### What content is included?

All tiers include:

- **130+ hours** of biblical audio
- **39+ hours** of teaching videos
- **Bibles** that are in the public domain
- Sermon series of the books of Daniel and Revelation
- **26GB+** total content - full content breakdown [Rapture Kit Content](/support/rapture-kit-content)

### Can I add my own content?

<Callout type="info" title="Custom RKPi5 Configuration">
Currently, the content is pre-curated.
</Callout>

- The RKPi5 scripts build on the specific use case of turning a stock Raspberry Pi5 8GB and configuring it for a static web portal using a captive Wi-Fi portal.
- The scripts are free and you are allowed to customize the scripts to your exact specification
- It takes extremely detailed technical background to modify these scripts, beware of the learning curve
- Using AI coding models can help, but be prepared for extensive iteration and testing requirements
- **WARNING** We do not support altered codebase(s). The moment you fork the code, you are on your own.

### What languages are available?

**Current**: English only
**Multi-languages**: Are natively prewritten. This includes the Post Rapture Emergency Message PDF documents, and the many Scripture Booklets in multiple titles and languages.

## Technical Questions

### How long does the battery last?

**6+ hours** of typical use.

Factors affecting battery life:
- Number of connected users (more users = faster drain)
- Content type (video uses more than audio)
- WiFi signal strength

### What's the WiFi range?

Approximately **100 feet (30 meters)** in open space. The distance drops considerably if the Wi-Fi signal goes through walls. Of course, the wall composition dramatically affects signal pennetraction. Room style walls (wood, insulation, wall board) is much easier than concrete with rebar.

Actual range depends on:
- Physical obstacles (walls, furniture)
- Interference from other devices
- Building materials

### Can I use it while charging?

Yes! RKPi5 works normally while charging. There's no need to power down for charging.

### What happens if battery dies while in use?

- RKPi5 is very resilient to sudden loss of power
- Because there is no **data** transactions, there is very little risk
- Essentially, the RKPi5 is a READ-ONLY content reader rendered from static content

### Is there a warranty?

<Callout type="info" title="Warranty Information">
RKPi5 is offered **As Is** and does not include warranty or suitability for purpose
</Callout>

Hardware Warranty:
- The Raspberry Pi5 vendor will support returns and/or replacements for defective Hardware
- Batteries and solar panels are likewise supported by the vendor / manufacturers
- TEST the hardware you purpose as soon as possible to make sure you validate that your hardware is good to go.
- NOTE: Typically, if hardware works on bootup or usage, it will stay running until manufacturer end-of-life

### Can I upgrade later?

Upgrades are rare, but we do expect to have them from time to time

- We offer any upgrades for free. We want to encourage maximum adoption with zero friction. Money should never impede the Gospel.
- The upgrades are contained to **install scripts** and/or the **content**
- If an update is announced, it means a complete new installation effort
- NOTE: There are no automatic update detections. This is a violation of our privacy and secrecy philosophy. We do not want internet connection activity at all. This could be detected by the bad guys.

## Security & Privacy

### Is my data private?

<Callout type="success" title="Privacy First">
RKPi5 operates completely offline.
</Callout>

- No cloud connection required
- No usage tracking, cookies, or hooks
- No data collection. By no ... we mean NO!
- No accounts or registration needed (it is annonymous)

### Is the WiFi network secure?

Yes, the 'rapture_kit' WiFi captive portal is SSL encrypted

### Can it be used in countries with restrictions?

RKPi5 operates entirely offline with no external communications, making it ideal for restrictive environments. However, check local laws regarding:

- WiFi device operation
- Content restrictions
- Encryption regulations
- Keyboard layouts are part of the Pi OS 64-bit Trixie image
